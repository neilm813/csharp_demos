/* 
- Create enqueue and dequeue methods. _You can loop and index the underlying array._
- Design a new PriorityQueue class where the queue maintains an ascending order when items are added based on a queue item's provided priority integer value. A priority value of 1 is most important which means it should be at the front of the queue, the first to be dequeued.
- A priority queue item could be any data type.
